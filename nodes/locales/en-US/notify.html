    <p>
        Notifies an event from a Sony audio device via the Sony Audio Control API.
    </p>
    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
        This node listens for notifications and provides the event data.
    </p>
    <p>
        See Sony <a href="https://developer.sony.com/develop/audio-control-api/api-references/api-overview-2">Audio Control API</a>
        reference for more details about the notification methods and their parameters.
    </p>
    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <dt>Name</dt>
    <dd>Optionally specify a name for the node.</dd>
    <dt>Device</dt>
    <dd>Select / configure the Sony audio device.</dd>
    <dt>Topic</dt>
    <dd>
        Specify the topic which should be included in the output messages. If
        left blank, no topic is added to the messages. You can use placeholders
        in the form <code>{{placeholder}}</code> to insert variable content.
        The following placeholders are supported:
    </dd>
    <dl class="message-properties">
        <dt>device<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the name of the device node</dd>
        <dt>notify<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the name of this node</dd>
        <dt>host<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the host name / IP address of the device</dd>
        <dt>service<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the API service name</dd>
        <dt>method<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the API method name</dd>
        <dt>version<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
        <dd>the API version number</dd>
    </dl>
    <dt>Outputs</dt>
    <dd>Select the outputs to be provided by the node.</dd>
    <dt>Service</dt>
    <dd>Select the service for the events you want to get notified for.</dd>
    <dt>Events</dt>
    <dd>
        Select one or more notifications to subscribe for corresponding to the
        selected service.
    </dd>
    <dt>Filters</dt>
    <dd>
        You can use filters to filter the event data by certain criteria. Add,
        remove or reorder filters and select the type of filter. The number on
        the right side shows the number of the output to which the result of
        the filter will be sent. The auto filter automatically selects a filter
        matching the type of the notification. The custom filter lets you define
        the filter yourself based on a JSONata expression. The expression can
        be directly entered or loaded from a global or flow context variable.
    </dd>
    <h3>Outputs</h3>
    <p>
        The node provides a variable number of outputs which can be selected via
        the configuration page. By default, only the <i>Filter</i> outputs are
        active.
    </p>
    <ol class="node-ports">
        <li>Filters
            <p>
                Each configured filter provides a dedicated output port to
                which its filtered data is sent.
            </p>
            <dl class="message-properties">
                <dt class="optional">topic<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
                <dd>
                    the configured topic with placeholders being substituted
                    by dynamic content.
                </dd>
                <dt>payload<span class="property-type">boolean | number | string | object</span></dt>
                <dd>
                    the filtered data of the received notification; messages
                    are only sent on these ports if the event data is
                    applicable to any of the filters.
